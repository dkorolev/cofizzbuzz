# `cofizzbuzz`

An illustrative example of FizzBuzz on C++20 coroutines.

## Notes

The coded uses all the `using`-s so that the innermost snippets are as clean as possible.

Obviously, in production code, such `using`-s are strictly discouraged.

My motivation is to maximize the density of code per keyword seen by the reader, so that ex-Python and ex-Golang folks are less afraid of C++.
